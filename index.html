                <div class="container"><p>Residential redlining plays an important role in the overall idea of systemic racism. Which is the practice of denying a credit worthy applicant a loan for housing in a certain neighborhood even though the applicant may otherwise be eligible. Redlining not only impacts where one lives, but their environmental quality and economic opportunity. Although redlining is a residential issue, it is one that can go on to affect much more in an individual's life. While certain races are directed to live in one area based on preconceived judgements, others are kept away to uphold the level of “civility” one may think is done by separating by race. We chose to cover redlining because it has the power to ultimately impact education, jobs, and other opportunities for a family. This has been a prevalent social issue beginning around the 1930s and has continued into today's society, so we felt it was worth researching for our final proposal project. One specific story from a 2020 California Health Report by Denzel Tongue, was about an African American couple who found themselves affected by redlining in Oakland, CA. In 1974 they were trying to purchase a home in the area and faced expected difficulties as did many others during that time. There is a map shown from the 1937 Home Owners Loan Corporation of Oakland map which determined where the black families were allowed to purchase homes and where they were not. The red areas on the map were given a grade “D” for high risk, in reality it just had a higher population of black people living there. The husband, Dave Cambell was a US Air Force veteran but his country still had little respect for him because of his race. He and his wife had to eventually reside in West Oakland due to this racial discrimination that real estate agents used. This is just one real example of redlining, but this same story happens to millions of people and families throughout the US. There is no excuse for segregating residential areas, it is simply based on pure systemic racism and will continue to prevent individuals from having equal opportunity.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">“The Most Insidious Legacy” is significant because it shows how redlining has impacted many African American families for years. Redlining may be illegal now but any neighborhoods that were once redlined are still suffering. There is evidence of a “long-run decline in homeownership, house values, and credit scores making it difficult for African American families to perfect the “wealth-building-home homeownership.” The article highlights the damage redlining has permanently caused and the gaps it has created “between black and white communities in America, both historically and now.” The consequences of redlining affect the lives of many socially, academically, and financially.</p>

This problem began in the 1930s and ended in the 1960s but unfortunately the damage had been done for years. This problem of segregation was now embedded in cities. It still is a problem around the world in neighborhoods today. </p>

This engenders and exacerbates areas where it is undeveloped. In other words, minority neighborhoods, where health care, educational opportunities and shelter areas are hardly accessible, will keep getting worse as nobody is willing to invest in these regions. Additionally, it is a discriminatory act that consists of systemtic denial which can cause bias and unhealthy stereotypes. </p>

Redlining is a severe issue in Midwest and Northeast areas of the United States. Cities that experience redlining heavily are Cleveland, Detroit, Baltimore, Pittsburgh, and more according to recent studies. Being an African American in Detroit I actually experienced redlining and hypersegregation myself. Most of Detroit is African American with poor living conditions, high crime rates, and problems with healthcare. When you are driving from Detroit to the Suburbs such as West Bloomfield, Farmington, or any suburban area near Detroit you can actually see the difference between the two. Rather that be the road conditions, looks of schools and homes, or the fact that police are not heavily surrounded in these areas. Redlining will forever be an issue I feel like this goes back to the times of segregation and housing acts in which white flight occured causing the Cacuasians to leave neighborhoods that were being integrated with minors. When they left the business and the conditions went down as the minorities could not maintain the conditions because of their low economic wealth.

                                    <p class="mb-4">The image represents how real estate agents would pass a house for sale because of the race of who wants to get a house that in the image is a black couple. Developers tell agents to avoid selling certain homes to black families because they want to keep those houses for white families. They believe that the house's values will drop if a black family moves into the area. The redlining shows that it is an area where there is a black resident in the neighborhood. Why have they thought this? Why do they believe that white families work less than black families in real estate? The agents want more white families to move in because they want more profits. Read about Dale Taylor, a young realtor, what he had an experience when he said, "I watched that White flight happen." Five white families were on the block when he bought his first house in Matteson. When he moved in, all the white families moved out. Then the developer built new homes in Matteson near the town of Frankfort. What shocked Dale Taylor? When he discovered that the developers told real estate agents not to sell any of those houses in the new neighborhoods to black families because they didn't want the value rates to lower. This image shows how real estate agents take advantage of black people who want to get a house because they put all their trust into the real estate agent to find them an amazing home and the agents break their trust only to show a few homes out of many other ones just because of their race.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">This image represents redlining how they would mark a black resident's house on the map with a red line around the area and, in this case, a house. Do you notice that every house has the same color of green, except the black residents' house color, purple and pink? Why purple and pink colors for a house? The concept of having a bright color for anything, like a house around houses that are blander in color, makes them stick out more than the other houses. Do you notice every house has a house next to it? But only the house with the black resident's house with red lining around it has no one on the left side of the land. What could be why there isn't a house next to them? When a house is marked with a red line, it's considered a risky investment and dangerous. On top of that, the market value of the house lowers. When you look in the background, you see hands looking up and down to find and search for a black resident to mark the red line around the house.Through this image it shows redlining and how it affects the black residents in the neighborhood. </p>
